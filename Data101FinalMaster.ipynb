    "### Our project strives to look at how certain student habits, such as extracurricular hours and studying hours, might have an influence on GPA. By observing 4 data sets, each from different locations and/or subjects, we plan to find a correlation between certain habits and GPA. Our data sets explore data sets from India, Malaysia, and Portugal as a way to see if certain findings are universal."

    "We are exploring how students habits affect their final grade in their classes. Specifically, we are seeing how their attendance, study time, their activities outside of school, and free time they have affect their final grade in their courses. Also, we have multiple data sets from different locations: India, Portugal, and Malaysia, which provides diversity of differing education systems. It will allow us to have a better understanding on how students' habits impact their performance in school and their final grade. It is interesting how splitting up student's time can truly impact their grade, for better or worse. Our analysis is relevant because student's should care and pay attention to how their habits impact their grades because that dictates their education, which is very important in life and can be to their futures. This analysis can bring attention to students' habits, positive or negative, and encourage students' to alter their habits or continue to live them normally. "

    "### This data was obtained publicly from Kaggle. In this data, there are 8 variables and 2000 observations. This data is primarily from India, where 2000 students answered a survey through a google form. The data is a dataset of various lifestyle and academic habits/aspects of 2000 students. The data was collected from August 2023 to May 2024. There are not really any ethical concerns as there is no data that will connect any data to one person. The student ID column is simply an index column rather than an identification column. The data simply consists of inputs, such as numbers, which is not revealing of anything personal.\n",

    "#### The 8 variables consist of: Student_ID is an integer, which serves more as an index number so it will not really be taken into account, Study_Hours_Per_Day, which is a float, which represents the amount of hours that a student spends studying per day, Extracurricular_Hours_Per_Day, Sleep_Hours_Per_Day, Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day, and GPA are all floats and they are exactly what they say which is the amount of hours that a student does the corresponding activity per day, Social_Hours_Per_Day is a float and it represents how much times a student spends socializing per day, and Stress_Level is an object and it is a self report of a students stress level which can be reported as Low, Moderate, and High."
