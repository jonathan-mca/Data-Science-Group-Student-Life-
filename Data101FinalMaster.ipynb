    "### Our project strives to look at how certain student habits, such as extracurricular hours and studying hours, might have an influence on GPA. By observing 4 data sets, each from different locations and/or subjects, we plan to find a correlation between certain habits and GPA. Our data sets explore data sets from India, Malaysia, and Portugal as a way to see if certain findings are universal."

    "We are exploring how students habits affect their final grade in their classes. Specifically, we are seeing how their attendance, study time, their activities outside of school, and free time they have affect their final grade in their courses. Also, we have multiple data sets from different locations: India, Portugal, and Malaysia, which provides diversity of differing education systems. It will allow us to have a better understanding on how students' habits impact their performance in school and their final grade. It is interesting how splitting up student's time can truly impact their grade, for better or worse. Our analysis is relevant because student's should care and pay attention to how their habits impact their grades because that dictates their education, which is very important in life and can be to their futures. This analysis can bring attention to students' habits, positive or negative, and encourage students' to alter their habits or continue to live them normally. "

    "### This data was obtained publicly from Kaggle. In this data, there are 8 variables and 2000 observations. This data is primarily from India, where 2000 students answered a survey through a google form. The data is a dataset of various lifestyle and academic habits/aspects of 2000 students. The data was collected from August 2023 to May 2024. There are not really any ethical concerns as there is no data that will connect any data to one person. The student ID column is simply an index column rather than an identification column. The data simply consists of inputs, such as numbers, which is not revealing of anything personal.\n",

    "### As an extra analysis, we observed sleep hours. On first glance of the graph, we could already tell that sleep has little to no effect on GPA, which is surprising. We expected that as one slept less, the less focused one would be on their education. However, this scatter plot does not support that hypothesis. The score of the line is 0.001 and is slightly negative with a slope of -0.001. The trendline shows that there is little to no correlation between sleep and GPA.\n",

    "### Using dummy data and a linear fit, we were able to get a score of a linear fit based on multiple variables and using them to predict GPA. The adjusted R^2 score is 0.5401. The linear fit suggests that using 'Study Hours', 'Extracurricular Hours', 'Social Hours', 'Physical Activity Hours',' Stress Level_High',' Stress Level_Moderate', and 'Stress Level_Low', around 54 percent of the data can be explained by the linear fit. The score is not exactly what we had expected, as we had hypothesized that certain variables, such as studying hours, would cause the score to shift higher.\n",

    "### Earlier, we saw that study hours had a good correlation with average GPA, but here we see that by including other variables, the score lowers significantly. The slope of study hours for the linear fit here is 0.157, and the one earlier was 0.152. Although they had similar slopes, the new, much lower score, which was around 98 percent earlier, shows how little influence the other variables have in comparison to study hours. However, we also have to take into account how earlier we used AVERAGE GPA, and for our linear fit, we used all GPA points; this could have greatly affected our linear fit. This also suggests that studying hours might have less of an influence on GPA than originally thought."
